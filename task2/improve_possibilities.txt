The software might be improved by:

adding GUI to it,
implementing it at website as an API (?search={keyword}, answer -> json containing list of links)
make it scrape at maximum time allowed by website to make sure that user wont get banned
add settings as an external file(how much pages should it scrap etc.)

risks associated with using such a program:

your account/ip might get banned if website from which you're scraping dont allow it
